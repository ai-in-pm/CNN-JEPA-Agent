# CNN-JEPA: Detailed Explanation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of CNN-JEPA (Convolutional Neural Network Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), its implementation, and how it works.

## 1. Conceptual Overview

### What is CNN-JEPA?

CNN-JEPA is a novel self-supervised learning method that adapts the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) framework, previously successful with Vision Transformers (ViTs) via I-JEPA, to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It addresses the inherent challenges of using masked inputs and predictive architectures with CNNs through several key innovations.

### Key Innovations

1. **Sparse CNN Encoder**: CNN-JEPA incorporates a sparse CNN encoder architecture capable of handling masked inputs and generating masked feature maps. This is a significant innovation as standard CNNs are not inherently designed to process masked inputs effectively.

2. **Efficient Predictor Design**: The method proposes a novel, efficient, fully convolutional predictor using depthwise separable convolutions to manage the high dimensionality of CNN feature maps. This design is both parameter and computationally efficient.

3. **CNN-Compatible Masking**: CNN-JEPA refines the masking strategy to align with CNN downsampling and typically predicts a single masked region, unlike I-JEPA's multiple target regions.

4. **Architectural Simplicity**: The approach achieves strong performance with minimal data augmentations (only random resized crop) and without a separate projector network, unlike many other SSL methods.

### Data Flow

1. An image is divided into patches and processed through the model.
2. A masking pattern is applied, hiding ~40% of the image.
3. The masked image is processed by the sparse context encoder, which propagates the mask through the network.
4. The original, unmasked image is processed by the target encoder to generate target features.
5. The predictor takes the context features and predicts features for the masked regions.
6. The L2 distance between predicted and target features is calculated only at masked locations.
7. The context encoder and predictor are updated via gradient descent, while the target encoder is updated via EMA.

## 2. Architecture

### Sparse CNN Encoder

The sparse CNN encoder is a modified CNN (typically ResNet-50) that can handle masked inputs:

- **Input**: Masked image with some regions hidden
- **Output**: Context features with mask information
- **Key Modifications**:
  - Propagates mask through the network
  - Applies convolutions only to visible regions
  - Downsamples mask along with feature maps
  - Ensures that masked regions remain masked throughout the network

### Efficient Predictor

The predictor is a fully convolutional network using depthwise separable convolutions:

- **Input**: Context features from the sparse encoder
- **Output**: Predicted features for masked regions
- **Design**:
  - 4 depthwise separable convolutional blocks
  - Maintains spatial dimensions of feature maps
  - Parameter-efficient (fewer parameters than standard convolutions)
  - Computationally efficient for high-dimensional feature maps

### Target Encoder

The target encoder is a standard CNN (typically ResNet-50) that processes the unmasked image:

- **Input**: Unmasked image
- **Output**: Target features
- **Key Difference**: Weights are updated via EMA of the context encoder

## 3. Implementation Details

### Sparse CNN Implementation

The sparse CNN encoder is implemented by modifying standard CNN blocks to handle masked inputs:

```python
class SparseCNNBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        
    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        x = self.conv(x)
        
        if mask is not None:
            # Apply mask to output
            x = x * mask
            
            # Downsample mask if stride > 1
            if self.conv.stride[0] > 1:
                mask = F.max_pool2d(mask, kernel_size=self.conv.stride[0],
                                   stride=self.conv.stride[0])
        
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        
        return x, mask
```

### Depthwise Separable Convolution

The predictor uses depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency:

```python
class DepthwiseSeparableConv(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1):
        super().__init__()
        # Depthwise convolution (one filter per input channel)
        self.depthwise = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size,
                                  stride, padding, groups=in_channels)
        
        # Pointwise convolution (1x1 conv to mix channels)
        self.pointwise = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1)
        
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.depthwise(x)
        x = self.pointwise(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x
```

### Masking Strategy

CNN-JEPA uses a simplified masking strategy compared to I-JEPA:

```python
def create_cnn_mask(height, width, masking_ratio=0.4, block_size=32, num_target_blocks=1):
    # Calculate grid dimensions
    h_blocks = height // block_size
    w_blocks = width // block_size
    total_blocks = h_blocks * w_blocks
    
    # Initialize masks
    context_mask = np.ones((height, width))
    target_mask = np.zeros((height, width))
    
    # Calculate number of blocks to mask
    num_blocks_to_mask = int(total_blocks * masking_ratio)
    
    # Create a grid of block indices
    block_indices = np.arange(total_blocks)
    np.random.shuffle(block_indices)
    
    # Select target blocks
    target_block_indices = block_indices[:num_target_blocks]
    
    # Select remaining blocks to mask
    other_masked_block_indices = block_indices[num_target_blocks:num_blocks_to_mask]
    
    # Apply target blocks to masks
    for idx in target_block_indices:
        h_idx = idx // w_blocks
        w_idx = idx % w_blocks
        
        h_start = h_idx * block_size
        h_end = min((h_idx + 1) * block_size, height)
        w_start = w_idx * block_size
        w_end = min((w_idx + 1) * block_size, width)
        
        context_mask[h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end] = 0
        target_mask[h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end] = 1
    
    # Apply other masked blocks to context mask
    for idx in other_masked_block_indices:
        h_idx = idx // w_blocks
        w_idx = idx % w_blocks
        
        h_start = h_idx * block_size
        h_end = min((h_idx + 1) * block_size, height)
        w_start = w_idx * block_size
        w_end = min((w_idx + 1) * block_size, width)
        
        context_mask[h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end] = 0
    
    return context_mask, target_mask
```

## 4. Training Process

### Loss Function

CNN-JEPA uses a simple L2 loss between predicted and target features, but only at masked locations:

$$L = \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} \| f_\theta(x_i^{ctx}) - g_\xi(x_i) \|_2^2$$

Where:
- $f_\theta$ is the predictor applied to context features
- $g_\xi$ is the target encoder
- $x_i^{ctx}$ is the masked input with only context regions visible
- $x_i$ is the original unmasked input
- $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of masked locations
- $N_m$ is the number of masked locations

### Optimization

- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Learning Rate**: 1.5e-4 with cosine decay
- **Weight Decay**: 0.05
- **Batch Size**: 2048
- **Training Epochs**: 300-800

### Target Encoder Update

The target encoder is updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the context encoder:

$$\xi \leftarrow \alpha \xi + (1 - \alpha) \theta$$

Where:
- $\xi$ are the target encoder parameters
- $\theta$ are the context encoder parameters
- $\alpha$ is the EMA coefficient (typically 0.996-0.999)
